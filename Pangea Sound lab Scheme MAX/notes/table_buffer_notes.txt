Notes on table and buffer io

DONE & TESTED
- table? 
- table-length              (tabl)  (table-length table)   
- table-ref                 (tabr)
- table-set!                (tabs)
- table->vector             (t->v)
- vector-set-from-table!    (vecst)  (vector-set-from-table! vector {vec-index} 'table {index} {count})
- table-set-from-vector!    (tabsv)  (table-set-from-vector! table {table-index} 'vector {index} {count})
- buffer? 
- buffer-size? 
- buffer-ref {name} {chan} {index} 
- buffer-set! {name} {chan} {index}
- buffer->vector {name}

TODO
- buffer-channels
- buffer->vector 
- vector-set-from-buffer!


LATER:
(buffer->vector* {buff} {start} {count}) 
  - returns multi-dimensional vector from all channels in the buffer

- returns a vector from a buffer
(vector-set-from-buffer! vector {vstart} {buffer} {chan} {bstart-opt} {count-opt}

- later add multi-dimensional versions to work with multi-dimensional vectors


ALSO NEED
- buffer-channels

BUFF tests:

IN PROGRESS:
- working on buffer-set-from-vector! 

(buffer-set-from-vector! buffer {opt-chan} {opt-buff-index} vector {opt-start} {opt-count}) 

- buffer-set-from-vector! is now working for single channel buffers

- LEFT OFF 2020-09-19
  - need to figure out other buffer channels
  - needs tests written for it, should be able to copy all the tests from the table tests patcher
