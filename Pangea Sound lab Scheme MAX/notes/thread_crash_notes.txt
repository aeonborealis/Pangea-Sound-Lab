Thread crash notes:

Function docs:
s4m_read( symbol )
  - defers a message to doread, with the symbol arg

static s7_pointer s7_load_from_max(s7_scheme *s7, s7_pointer args) - 1734
  - just calls s4m_doread under the hood

732: void s4m_doread(t_s4m *x, t_symbol *s, bool is_main_source_file, bool skip_s7_load)
  - meant to handle all file reading
  - does not defer or promote
  - implementation notes:
    - checks for symbol, or gets one with popup
    - locates file, getting fullpath
    - has special editor logic for if is_main_source_file
    - loads file into scheme by calling s4m_s7_load


1041: void s4m_s7_load(t_s4m *x, char *full_path)
  - surrounds and calls the s7_load built in function
  - which means this can definitely *only* be called from the correct threa

2012-03-14:
- fixed issues with read and reset, seems to be fine now
- not sure if how doread works for main file should still be overhauled or not
