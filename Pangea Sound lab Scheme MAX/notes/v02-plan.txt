Plan for version 0.2
- table i/o
- buffer i/o
- scheduling with ms
- scheduling with clock

Status:
- regression test suite working for the schedule and transport tests
- working on completing the regression test suite
- 


V0.2 need to do:
- add the global control for turning off logging
- add the table tests to the regression suite

table-io-tests-1 is not working right (not all passing)


Issues to solve for release
- logging control?? have I done that yet??

TODO: rename dict-get to dict-ref and dict-set to dict-set!

- switch dict-get and dict-set over to dict-ref and dict-set! 
  to be consistent with scheme naming (hash-table-ref hash-table-set!)
  - short form will be dictr dicts  

need to rename the transport stuff for consistency too,
- ie transport-set-state to transport-state-set!


ISSUES:
- oops it looks like I never made vector-set-from-buffer! fuck
