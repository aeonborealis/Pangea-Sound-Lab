- to add to docs:
- vectors of ints and reals supported, not other values
- numbers of ints and reals supported only (no rational or complex)

- need a disclaimer that "ins", "outs", and "thread" are attributes
  and so won't get passed to scheme automatically (ie don't name functions
  ins, outs, thread, or reset
