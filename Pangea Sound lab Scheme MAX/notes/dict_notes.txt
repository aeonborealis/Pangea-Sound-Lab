Dict notes:

- dict-set {dict-name} {key} {value}
  - working, need to add GC protection I think
- dict-get {dict-name} {key} {value}

- dict-get {dict-name} {key-list} 
- dict-set {dict-name} {key-list} {value}

- (dict->hash-table 'dict-name)
- (hash-table->dict 'dict-name)

- (dict-keys)
- (hash-table-keys)

- (dict-iter 'dict (lambda (k,v)() )

For V0.2:
- dict-get dict-set
- dict->hash, hash->dict
- ? dict-keys
- ? dict-values

- dict-find working now for recursing through dicts and arrays
- dict-replace
- dict-put, as with dict-find, does not make entries if key bad (returns null)


IN PROGRESS:
- figure out how they should be in the actual API
- got a version making hierarchies ok! it's in the code right now as dict-put, 
  but should be renamed to dict-replace

LEFTOFF
- need to re-route the functions so that:
  - dict-set can take a list as first arg and uses what is currently in there as dict-replace
  - dict-replace should use what is in there as dict-put
- then I think we are code complete for V0.2. Phew!
 
Final version
- dict-set
  - works with key as list or values

- I think dict-put just becomes dict-replace now??0
