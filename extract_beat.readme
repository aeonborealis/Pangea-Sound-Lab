This script uses the librosa library to analyze the audio file and extract the beat 
frames using the librosa.beat.beat_track() function. The beat frames are then converted
to MIDI format using the midiutil library and exported as a MIDI file named "beat.mid".
The script assumes that the tempo of the beat is in beats per minute (BPM), and it adds
a MIDI note on each beat frame, with the same pitch (36) and the same duration (0.25s) 
and velocity (100) so you can adjust it according to your needs.
Also, keep in mind that beat tracking is a complex task and the results may vary depending
on the audio file, you may want to adjust the parameters of the librosa.beat.beat_track()
function or use different methods to get better results.
