This script uses the librosa library to load, scramble, time stretch, and arpeggiate
the audio data, and the numpy and scipy libraries to concatenate and resample the 
audio data. Also, note that this script uses the golden ratio (1.618) as the arpeggiation
intervals, but you can use any other ratio.

It is important to mention that this script is a proof of concept, it might not sound 
nice, and it might not be useful in real-world applications, also the output file might
be huge, and the script might take a long time to finish. This script uses randomness
so the output will be different every time you run it.
